Hi, my name is Tyler Crum,

  I am a Software Developer currently scheduled to graduate with a Bachelors of Computer Science from the Unversity of Utah in Fall of 2022.

  I use this Github to showcase my projects and to allow me to grow as a developer, I am interested in Backend Development, Web Development, and DevOps.
